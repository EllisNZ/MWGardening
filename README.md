I've started an MCM and the use of pots/planters. Still very rough. Instructions on playing in the MCM.

There is a barrel that contains the tools and supplies to make testing easier. Just use the console to bring it up:
placeAtPC, "gard test barrel", 1, 10, 1

The gardenener class is modified so that you can buy planters and tools from them. The only original gardener is Gee Pop Varis in Temple Courtyard, Mournhold. He sells Mournhold style planters. I've added another gardener in Vivec Foriegn Quarter who sells Vivec style planters. I'm thinking of making the TR gardeners barterers too.
